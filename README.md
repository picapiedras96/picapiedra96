## About Me

I am currently trying to persue a career as a prgramer. I am in my third year of college and know a couple of programing languages, mostly Python. However, I have no real outside of school or project experience when it comes to programing. I am mostly focusing on Python and machine learning curretnly. I am from Mexico so I apologize in advance if my english is bad.

##Fun Facts:
* I have pet cat üê±, her name is "Estrella" or star. Howver, she only responds to "Gata".
* I like to put hot sauce on hot cheetos.
* I hate penaut butter and choclate combinations, "please don't kill me".
